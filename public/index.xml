      <description>In the last unit of SDS 348 or Computational Biology this semester, I learned some very interesting skills about the coding language Python. While I had taken an introductory course to Python a semester earlier, I ended up gaining more useful skills from this course. For example, by importing the regex library, I learned how to use the findall() method which allows you to find a specific character or element in a collection of several items.</description>

      <description>Wasim Meghani, wam2233  Introduction For as long as I can remember, basketball has always been a sport that I have enjoyed playing and watching on TV. It requires endless hours of practicing in order to perfect, and athletes who end up making the National Basketball Association (NBA) have been studying and playing the game their entire lives. One measure of analytics to determine the efficiency of a player on the court is the real plus minus (RPM).</description>

      <description>Wasim Meghani, wam2233  Introduction From a very young age, I have loved watching and playing basketball due to the thrill of the game. It takes serious individual talent in order to make plays and score baskets, which is why efficiency statistics such as real plus minus, ORPM, and DRPM are so important in determining the value of a specific player. The dataset I chose contains all player and team data from the 2017 NBA season that particularly explores efficiency ratings of players based on real plus minus, or RPM.</description>
